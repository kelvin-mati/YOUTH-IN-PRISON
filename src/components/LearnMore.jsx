            Prisons are a corrective facility for individuals found to be on the
            wrong side of the law. However, many persons who are jailed end up
            finding themselves back in prison.

            This suggests that a lot still needs to be done for prisons to
            realize their goals of correcting behavior and discouraging repeat
            offenders.

            Unfortunately, the society does not provide a conducive environment
            for prisoners upon returning home from prison which further
            complicates the journey towards transforming the behavior of former
            prisoners.

            Many people in the society tend to abandon their people or loved
            ones once they are convicted and slapped with a life in prison, both
            in Kenya and Africa as a society which is against the constitution
            and biblical teaching of Mathew 25:36.

            Youth in Prison organization came in to being through identifying
            this gap in the formation and transformation of inmates and
            ex-inmates and thus embarked on a journey to support prisoners in
            Kenya with a global eye of African Society on the need to ensure the
            transformative agenda of the prisoners is realized. This was to be
            achieved through the vision, mission, strategies, activities and
            collective resources towards achieving this pertinent goal.

        <Typography>
          <li>
            In Kenya we have about 250 Prisons with Nairobi region having
            approximate ten (10) Prisons , where nine (9) of them are secured
            for Men with one being for Women.
          </li>
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          <li>
            Most of the Prisons were started by colonizers and congestion have
            been one of the biggest challenge.
          </li>
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          <li>
            Women Prisons are allowed to have children below 4years with them
            where after they are enrolled back to the society. Youth in prison
            organization saw the need to incorporate kids/children in prison as
            part of our objectives and a “Children in Prisons” docket was
            officially incorporated.

            In Kenyan Prisons, about 80% of inmates are Youths below 30 years
            according to the report by the Agha Khan University Report 2016.

            A youth refers to a collectivity of individuals in the Republic of
            Kenya who have attained the age of eighteen (18) years but have not
            attained the age of thirty five (35) years.

        <Typography>
          <li>
            Some openly referred to statements by inmates in Africa is “Life in
            Prison is better “ than out here…, one inmates proclaimed. This is
            because out here their lives appears to be more in danger than in
            prisons because they feel safe and in as much as they lack freedom,
            there is no struggle with the tough economic times since the
            government is “taking care” of him.

          <li>
            Looking at the well being of inmates was not an enough
            transformational agenda as we also saw the need of incorporating
            motivation and mentorship to the Prison staff/officers as part of
            volunteers in supporting the vision for the organization.

            Part of the motivation has been through holding monthly prayer

            their mental wellness and togetherness as they undertake their
            duties.
